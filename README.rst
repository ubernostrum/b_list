b_list
======

This is the source code of the `Django
<https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ project which powers `my personal
blog <http://www.b-list.org>`_. It includes both my personal blog
application and the app I use to track my open-source projects, which
previously were in separate repositories.

This repository exists mainly to provide a consistent point for me to
deploy from. It may or may not be useful to you, and does not actually
include *everything* -- some settings are specified via environment
variables, for example -- and is designed with my personal needs in
mind.

I run on Django 3.0 and Python 3.8; other Django and/or Python
versions may work, but are not tested or supported. In fact, this
project as a whole is not really "supported" except insofar as I'm
personally interested in having my own site work.

As such, if you find yourself needing to modify anything here -- and
ideally you should just set up your own project if you want to use any
of the applications here, you should feel free (it's BSD-licensed),
but I likely will be unresponsive to issues or pull requests.
